# ⚡ TI EV Power Converter Project Documentation

This repository contains all documentation and reference files for the **Bidirectional DC-DC Converter** project based on Texas Instruments' 7.4 kW design guide — a project aimed at improving energy flow for electric vehicle applications in the agriculture sector.

> 🧪 Done during my internship at **Boson Motors**, this project reflects my hands-on experience in power electronics, converter design, and embedded systems documentation.
